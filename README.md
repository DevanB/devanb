## 🔭 Current Initiatives

Currently, I'm building two applications and (continuing) to learn a foreign language:

- [LucidLog](https://github.com/DevanB/lucidlog) is an innovative journaling tool designed to unlock the mysteries of your dreams. Built on Ruby on Rails, Inertia, and React, the app is a passion project born from my wife's enjoyment of analyzing her dreams. The goal is to use AI to analyze, summarize, and provide further details on a dream that a user has journaled. Even if the AI hallucinates, who cares! It is just your dreams after all; the mind is exploring itself.
- [HiveTool](https://github.com/DevanB/hivetool) (name TBD) empowers beekeeper's who are growing apiaries through smart management and passionate care! The application is build on Laravel, Inertia, and React and is a dogfooding application for myself and my apiary. Honey bees are the backbone of American agriculture in many ways, so an application that supports these tiny powerhouses is a win. The application has several features including an inspection scheduler, hive health metrics and monitoring, weather and task notifications, and general beekeeping guides.
- Mandarin Chinese may sound crazy, but I'm working on becoming fluent in the three business languages of the world: English (native proficiency), Spanish (working fluency), and Mandarin Chinese (elementary proficiency). I took Mandarin while in college, and have resolved that 2025 is the Year of Chinese Learning. I'm hoping to pass the HSK-1 this year.
