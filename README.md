## 🙋 About Me

I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Celebration Travel Group, passionate about building accessible and robust software solutions. With a strong focus on full-stack development, I specialize in TypeScript, JavaScript, and PHP. I thrive on creating inclusive user experiences and writing clean, maintainable code.

I've been writing code as a hobby since 2003 and professionally since 2015.
I am obsessed with creation and love figuring out the best way to solve
a problem.
